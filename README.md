# ping-webgame

Test what is it like to create a simple web game by following the article - Game Development - A Web Game in an Hour,
which was published on two servers:

*  http://www.sitepoint.com/build-a-web-game-in-an-hour-with-visual-studio-and-asp-net/
*  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn913185.aspx


It's really ugly, but kind of playable :D

*  Up, Down:  A, Z
*  Aim up/down and shoot: K/M + Spacebar
